    "I can provide a brief explanation of different data types and their examples. However, please note that creating a Word document is beyond the capabilities of this text-based interface. You can use the provided information to structure your document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Time Series Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded over a period with equal time intervals.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Stock prices over a month, temperature readings over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Image Data for Classification:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Image data involves visual information represented as pixel values. Classification involves assigning labels or categories to images.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Classifying images of cats and dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Rectangular/Tabular Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Rectangular data is structured as tables with rows and columns, and each row represents an individual record or observation.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A spreadsheet with columns for features (e.g., age, income) and rows for individual people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Text Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Text data involves sequences of characters, words, or documents, and natural language processing techniques are often applied.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Sentiment analysis of customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Categorical Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Categorical data represents categories or labels and doesn't have a meaningful numerical interpretation.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Colors (red, blue, green), types of fruits (apple, banana).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Numerical Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Numerical data consists of numbers and can be further categorized into discrete or continuous data.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Discrete - Number of cars in a parking lot; Continuous - Height of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Geospatial Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Geospatial data includes information about the Earth's surface and its features, often represented using coordinates.\n",
    "   - **Example:** GPS coordinates of locations on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Audio Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Audio data consists of sound signals and can be analyzed for various purposes, such as speech recognition or music classification.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Speech recordings for voice recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Video Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Video data is a sequence of images played in rapid succession, and analysis can involve object detection, tracking, or classification.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Analyzing surveillance footage for security purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Graph Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Graph data represents relationships between entities using nodes and edges.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Social network connections, where users are nodes and friendships are edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Temporal Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Temporal data involves information related to time, and it can include time stamps, durations, or time intervals.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Durations of user sessions on a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Sensor Data:\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Sensor data is collected from various sensors and can include measurements like temperature, pressure, or acceleration.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Accelerometer data from a wearable device.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples, and in many real-world scenarios, datasets may involve a combination of these data types. When working on a data analysis or machine learning project, understanding the nature of the data is crucial for choosing appropriate methods and algorithms."
